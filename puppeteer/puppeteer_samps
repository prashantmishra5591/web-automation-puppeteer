device underline not working
text showing big




1) Why it was taking lots of time to add background to the artboard.
2) When user add textbox then textbox is added top of the artboard, I think it should get add little bit downside. 
3) In mobile devices : Image rotation issue is still exist.
4) In mobile devices : Left toolbar is showing large after gets open i.e : backgrounds/stamps etc... 
5) Mobile Device : Stamps are added too small on the artbaord.
6) Ar projects are not loading when user redirects back from pdp page.
7) Drop shadow  appears to the textbox when there is a dark/solid background present.
8) stamps/images should not allow to the minimum shrink
9) Layout : When background is added and user add layout then all previously added "images/text" modal appear. (Same modal appear when user removes layout, when not any objects are added.)
10) When we move any object in canvas with "keyboard arrow key" it is moving slowly as compare to previously.

11) When user add stamps the stamps should be added right side of the canvas/artboard.
